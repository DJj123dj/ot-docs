In discord, most tickets follow a general style/flow which is almost exactly the same in every discord bot.
**Here is an example:**
- [Creation](#creation)
- [Claiming](#claiming)
- [Closing](#closing)
- [Reopening](#reopening)
- [Deletion](#deletion)

Learning this flow can also help you understand some commands & when to use them.
It doesn't make sense to use **reopen before the ticket has been closed**.
Or to **claim a ticket when it already has been answered**!
Also note that some messages & embeds are very important for Open Ticket & can't be deleted!

## Creation
When you create a ticket, you will be greeted with a small embed (which you can customise) with a few buttons. In Open Ticket, it's called the **header of the ticket**.

:::danger don't delete!
It's <C color="red">**very important**</C> to keep this message. It's used in the back-end of open ticket to identify the ticket.

If you still manage to delete it, <C color="red">**Open Ticket won't recognise the channel as a ticket anymore**</C>. As a result, you can't use commands, buttons & transcripts anymore!
:::

The buttons are for **[Claiming](#claiming)**, **[Closing](#closing)** & **[Deleting](#deletion)**!

## Claiming
You can claim a ticket by running the `/claim` command or using the claim button.
A claimed ticket doesn't do anything special.

✅ **Claiming is just a notifier for the support team that you are handling this ticket!**

In future versions, the ticket claiming system will be 10x more advanced! But still it's cool to have!

## Closing
When you close a ticket in Open Ticket, the creator of the ticket can't talk anymore (they can press buttons).
It's the step you do before deleting the ticket. A closed ticket can also be [reopened](#reopening) to continue the conversation.

✅ **Closing is mostly used when you are finished with the conversation, but you still want to keep the ticket open!**

## Reopening
If you have a [closed ticket](#closing) where you want to continue the conversation, you can reopen it.
Now, the creator of the ticket can talk again! And that's all! You can do it as many times as you want!

✅ **Reopening is used when you want to continue with the conversation!**

## Deletion
If you are sure that everything has been finished, you can delete the ticket. <C color="red">**Remember that this is permanent, you can't undo this action!**</C>
If you have enabled <InlineLink isdoc="true" url="docs/system/transcripts">**transcripts**</InlineLink>, the transcript will also be created.

And that's it, there is not much to say about it :)
