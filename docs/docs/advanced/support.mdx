Here we will explain what do do when you find an error, bug or something else that doesn't look right!
You can just follow the steps from top to bottom!

:::warning supported versions
We can only provide support for supported versions of Open Ticket. Most of the time it's the last major version, but [you can find a list here](https://otgithub.dj-dj.be/blob/main/.github/SECURITY.md#supported-versions)
:::

## STEP 1: Look at the error \{#step-1}
If you see an error, try to understand what it is trying to say. You may find the answer in this documentation!

### Config Errors
If the error starts with `"Open Ticket CONFIG ERROR"` or it looks like the image, then you should look at the url pinned below!
<GoodImage src="/img/docs/installation/console_checkerjs.png" size="70%"></GoodImage>
<LinkBlock mode="emoji" emoji="❓" isdoc="true" url="docs/system/config-errors" name="Open Ticket Config Errors!" description="What are these config errors?"></LinkBlock>

### Unknown Errors
When you see an error like this, it means that Open Ticket doesn't know the error. To solve the error, it's best to join our [discord server](https://discord.dj-dj.be) & ask for help from the support team.

## STEP 2: Check the docs \{#step-2}
If you've read the error, try to find a solution in the documentation. If you still don't find it, then you can ask for help! **Remember that you still can join our discord server, even if you don't have an error!**

## STEP 3: Support \{#step-3}
You can ask for support in our discord server, or you can DM `djj123dj`!
<LinkBlock mode="image" image="/img/logo/discord.png" isdoc="false" url="https://discord.dj-dj.be" name="Join our discord server!" description="DJdj Development"></LinkBlock>

If you don't have discord for some weird reason, you can always create an issue on github!
