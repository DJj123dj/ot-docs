:::info config colors
In the documentation, we will **always use the colors listed above** for mentioning the config files!
This way, you can find them back easily!
:::

## config.json
Config.json is **<ColorText color="blue">the most important one</ColorText>** from all of them!
In this file, you can configure almost the entire bot! This includes:
- Logging in
- Setting the bot status
- Creating tickets
- Customizing embeds
- And much more...

## transcriptconfig.json
Transcriptconfig.json is **<ColorText color="green">less important</ColorText>** than config.json!
You are **not required to configure this** file and so it is optional!
In this file, you can configure everything related to transcripts!

Open Ticket has 2 types of transcripts: `Text Transcripts` & `HTML Transcripts`!
The Text Transcripts are handled entirely within the bot itself.
Meanwhile, the HTML transcripts are sent to the Open Ticket API at our website.
There, they get processed and finally they are hosted on `transcripts.dj-dj.be`

<InlineLink url="docs/system/transcripts" isdoc="true">More info about transcripts can be found here!</InlineLink>

## api.json
Api.json is **<ColorText color="red">the least important one</ColorText>** from all of them!
This config file is mostly made for developers that want to disable a certain command to replace them with their own!
Here, you can disable every almost command & DM messages that the bot sends on certain events!

:::warning developers only
This config file is made for **developers only**!
Normal users shouldn't change too much in this file because it can affect the working of the bot!
