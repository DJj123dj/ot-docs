import {ColorText,LabelText,GoodImage,LinkBlock,InlineLink,FlexHorizontal} from "@site/src/components/openticket.jsx"

Open Ticket has a **live communication system called <ColorText color="blue">LiveStatus</ColorText>**.
This system can show messages when the bot starts. The messages are fetched from an online `json` file.

The messages shown are created by [DJj123dj](https://www.github.com/DJj123dj) from [DJdj Development](https://discord.dj-dj.be)!
<ColorText color="red">**It is recommended to read these messages**</ColorText> because they contain important information about updates, issues & announcements.

âœ… **LiveStatus is always shown at the startup screen before the logs!**

## Examples
Here are some examples of messages that could be sent:
- There is a new major update (cool new features,...)
- There is a new imporant update (security fixes, critical bugs,...)
- Something doesn't work like expected
- There is a HTML Transcript outage
- There are dangerous plugins being spread online (virusses, bot nukers,...)
- ...

## Variety
<ColorText color="green">**LiveStatus can show different messages for different target groups!**</ColorText>

Your bot can be included in a target group when they match a set of variables set by the system.
The variables that the bot will look for are the following:

- Version
- Language
- Plugins
- Slash Commands (enabled/disabled)
- Text Transcripts (enabled/disabled)
- HTML Transcripts (enabled/disabled)

## Safety
:::warning note
**LiveStatus** only downloads the json file and inspects the messages.
<ColorText color="red">**It doesn't upload any data from the bot to the internet!**</ColorText>
