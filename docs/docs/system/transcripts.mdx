Transcripts are a way of preserving tickets in Open Ticket. You can always look back in the chat & what has been said. Every message is labeled with a timestamp & [HTML Transcripts](#html) have some extra features!
Currently there are 2 types of transcripts in Open Ticket.

- [HTML Transcripts](#html) <ColorText color="green">(online / external)</ColorText>
- [Text Transcripts](#text) <ColorText color="red">(offline / internal)</ColorText>

**To use transcripts, you need to enable & configure them in `transcriptconfig.json`:**
<LinkBlock mode="emoji" emoji="⚙️" isdoc="true" url="docs/config/transcripts" name="transcriptconfig.json" description="Configure Text & HTML Transcripts!"></LinkBlock>

### Deletion \{#html-delete}
If you want to **delete a HTML Transcript**, you first need to join [our discord server](https://discord.dj-dj.be).
Then create a ticket or send a DM to djj123dj. There you can ask for deletion if you meet **at least 2** of the following requirements:
- ✅ You have the URL of the transcript <ColorText color="red">**(required)**</ColorText>
- ✅ You are a participant of the ticket <ColorText color="green">**(recommended)**</ColorText>
- ✅ You are the owner of the bot <ColorText color="green">**(recommended)**</ColorText>
- ✅ You are the owner of the server <ColorText color="green">**(recommended)**</ColorText>
- ✅ The subject of the ticket is about/related to you <ColorText color="green">**(recommended)**</ColorText>

**Why would you want to delete a HTML Transcript?**
- There is sensitive information in the ticket
- There are sensitive images in the ticket
- You just don't like it that there is still a log of your ticket hanging around

:::info auto removal
Once every `6 months`, HTML Transcripts older than `6 months` will be automatically removed! So make sure that you create screenshots from the transcript if you still need it!
