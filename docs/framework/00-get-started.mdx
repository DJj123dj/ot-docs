Hi there! Welcome to the Open Ticket **Framework Guide**! This part of the documentation provides in-depth guides about creating plugins based on the Open Discord framework. Using plugins, you can increase the functionality, customise existing features or add your entirely custom-made features!

This guide is targeted towards <C color="red">**Open Ticket v4.0.0**</C>! Older and newer versions may include changes, additions, or deprecated features.

## üöÄ Getting Started
To get started, familiarize yourself with the **Config** and **Commands** sections first. These are the core functionalities for setting up and managing Open Ticket in your Discord server.

## Use Cases \{#use-cases}
It's recommended to **read this page before creating plugins** if you didn't visit this page before!
<LinkBlock mode="emoji" emoji="üîå" isdoc="true" url="docs/system/plugins" name="Plugins!" description="What can Open Ticket plugins do & where can you find them?"></LinkBlock>

## Location & Filename \{#location-filename}
Open Ticket plugins are stored in the `./plugins/` directory! All plugins are required to have a filename with `.plugin.js`!
If your plugin doesn't have this, then it won't work!

:::tip filename tips
Please use a simple file name that is easy to remember, read & write. **Here are some tips:**
- ‚úÖ use lowercase characters & numbers (e.g. `moderation.plugin.js`)
- ‚úÖ use a dash (`-`) instead of spaces & underscores (e.g. `log-system.plugin.js`)
- ‚ùå don't use long file names (e.g. `this-is-a-very-cool-plugin.plugin.js`)
:::

## Plugin Structure \{#structure}
Every plugin needs to have some basic code that is required to run the plugin.
We will go trough the following code step-by-step!

```javascript title="example.plugin.js" showLineNumbers
//import discord
const discord = require("discord.js")
//import api & get modules
const {client,config,events,utils,actions} = require("../core/api/api.js")

//everything inside this function will be executed at startup
module.exports = () => {
    //...
}
```

### Imports & Modules \{#imports-modules}
The first part of the code are the imports. Here, you will import `discord.js` & the `Open Ticket API` for methods that plugins can use!

```javascript title="example.plugin.js"
//import discord
const discord = require("discord.js")
//import api & get modules
const {client,config,events,utils,actions} = require("../core/api/api.js")
```

Here you can find everything related to modules from the Open Ticket api!
|Module    |Type             |Notes                                                                       |
|----------|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|`client`  |`discord.Client` |The client of the bot. Used for almost everything!                          |
|`config`  |`object`         |The Open Ticket config. Same variables as `config.json`                     |
|`events`  |`object`         |Collection of Open Ticket events. Event listeners can be added!             |
|`utils`   |`object`         |<C color="orange">**[PARTIALLY BROKEN]**</C> Utilities like the log system & the database. |
|`actions` |`empty object`   |<C color="red">**[BROKEN]**</C> Using actions, plugins could control the bot in a limited way! (e.g. creating & closing tickets)|

All information about events can be found in the API Reference!

### The Main Code \{#main-code}
The main code is the part of the plugin that will be executed on startup. It's everything in the `module.exports` function!
Here, you need to put all the code from your plugin!

```javascript title="example.plugin.js"
//everything inside this function will be executed at startup
module.exports = () => {
    //...
}
```
## Examples \{#examples}
You can find many examples in the official plugin list. Here, you can also upload your own plugin if you want to make it a public plugin!
