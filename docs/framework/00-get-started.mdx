Hi there! Welcome to the Open Ticket **Framework Guide**! This part of the documentation provides in-depth guides about creating plugins based on the Open Discord framework. Using plugins, you can increase the functionality, customise existing features or add your entirely custom-made features!

This guide is targeted towards <C color="red">**Open Ticket v4.0.0**</C>! Older and newer versions may include changes, additions, or deprecated features.

## 🚀 Getting Started \{#start}
To get started, familiarize yourself with the built-in [**Config**](/docs/category/api-config) and [**Commands**](/docs/category/api-commands) from Open Ticket first. These are the core functionalities of the bot and you can learn a lot by looking at how they work.

Alright once you've done that, we will start with ***What are Open Ticket plugins exactly?***

### What Are Plugins?
Plugins allow you to <C color="blue">**extend and customize Open Ticket**</C> without modifying the source code of the bot. You can create new commands, change existing behaviors, store custom data and even integrate external APIs!

#### Why should you use plugins?
- 🛠 *Modular & Expandable* – Add or remove features without breaking Open Ticket.
- 🌍 *Community-Friendly* – Share plugins with others or use pre-built ones.
- 💼 *Improved Workflows* – Improve your workflow by customising Open Ticket to your requirements.
- 🔗 *Deep Integrations* – Plugins can deeply integrate into the system. This allows them to change *almost* everything!

#### What are some example plugins?
- 💬 *Reviews* - Create & customise your own review system!
- 📢 *Feedback* - Collect feedback & create forms for people to answer!
- 🏷️ *Tags* - Create tags & answer questions automatically using keywords!
- 📝 *Forms* - Create advanced forms and ask people for additional details!
- 🔄 *Rotating Status* - Create a rotating bot status & use dynamic variables from the bot!
- 💾 *SQLite Database* - Use an sqlite database for increased performances!
- 🎉 *Custom Embeds* - Create your own embeds and use them in your server!
- ⏰ *Reminders* - Create & manage customisable reminders in your server!
- 🎨 *Customisation* - Yep, you heard it right! Even more customisation!

:::note plugin repository
Most of these example plugins already exist in our [Open Discord Plugin Repository](https://odplugins.dj-dj.be).

This is the official location to download Open Ticket plugins.<br></br>All plugins here are scanned for malware and improved to maintain compatibility.

### Plugin Terminology
Before diving into development, it's important to understand a few key concepts of the Open Ticket framework:

#### Open Discord
The **Open Discord** framework is the core API that Open Ticket is built on. It provides almost essential functionalities of the bot. All plugins will also be executed by Open Discord!

✅ *You will interact with Open Discord a lot when developing plugins!*

#### Open Ticket
**Open Ticket** is the bot itself, built using the Open Discord framework. All of your plugins will be running within Open Ticket and are able to extend its functionalities.

✅ *Open Ticket can be compared with a **huge ticket-system plugin** for Open Discord!*

#### Workers
Workers are small functions or callbacks that execute in a priority-based order to perform specific tasks. They can be a part of one of the following categories:
- **Builders** – Construct messages, embeds, buttons, dropdowns, files or modals.
- **Responders** – Handle slash/text commands, buttons, dropdowns, modals and other interactions.
- **Actions** – Specialized workers to perform to execute major operations or handle mass-data in multiple steps without problems.

✅ *Workers allow multiple plugins to modify the same process without conflicts!*

#### Builders
Builders have workers that construct various elements of the bot’s UI, including:
- Messages
- Embeds
- Buttons
- Dropdowns (Select Menus)
- Files (Attachments)
- Modals

✅ *Builders allow multiple plugins to modify the same element without conflicts!*

#### Responders
Responders are specialized workers that handle interactions like:
- Slash/Text Commands
- Buttons
- Dropdowns (Select Menus)
- Modals
- Autocomplete
- User & Message Interactions

✅ *Responders allow multiple plugins to listen & react to the same user input without conflicts!*

#### Actions
Actions are specialized classes that contain **workers** to perform major operations, such as:
- Opening, closing, claiming & pinning a ticket
- Creating a transcript

✅ *Actions help in structuring & simplifying complex workflows inside the bot!*

#### Events
Events allow your plugin to listen for specific occurrences and respond accordingly.
Unlike workers, events cannot directly modify the default behavior of Open Ticket.

✅ *Events are useful when you want to trigger something new without overriding the existing behavior!*

#### Utilities
Utilities are globally available helper functions that provide essential operations such as:
- Formatting messages & emojis
- Handling timestamps
- Managing promises, async & timers

✅ *Use utilities to simplify your code and follow best practices!*

### Development Overview
Creating a plugin involves:
1. **Setting Up Your Plugin Environment** – Basic structure & configuration.
2. **Using the Plugin API** – Understanding the available tools & features.
3. **Registering Commands & Events** – Creating custom commands & responding to events.
4. **Storing & Managing Data** – Using databases, variables & custom configurations.
5. **Testing & Debugging** – Making sure everything works smoothly.
