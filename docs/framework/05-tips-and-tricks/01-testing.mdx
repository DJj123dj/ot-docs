#### ✅ Basic Testing Setup  

1. **Ensure Open Ticket is running** – Your bot must be online to load the plugin.  
2. **Place your plugin in the `/plugins/` directory** – Each plugin should have its own folder inside the `plugins/` directory.  
3. **Check your `plugin.json` file** – Make sure your plugin ID, version, and dependencies are correctly defined.  

#### 🔄 Enabling & Reloading Plugins  

- To enable your plugin, set `"enabled": true` in `plugin.json`.  
- Restart Open Ticket, or use the **reload command** to apply changes without restarting the bot.  

```bash
# Restart Open Ticket
npm run start  

# OR reload plugins in runtime (if supported)
/ticket reload-plugins
```

✅ *The reload command is useful for quick iterations without needing a full restart!*  

#### 📜 Checking for Errors  

If your plugin isn’t working as expected:  

- **Check the bot console** – Any syntax errors or missing dependencies will show up in the logs.  
- **Enable debug mode** – You can start Open Ticket with debug mode enabled for more detailed logs:  

```bash
npm run start --debug
```

- **Check the plugin loader logs** – If your plugin fails to load, Open Ticket will usually provide an error message explaining why.
