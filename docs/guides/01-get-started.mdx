### 📥 Downloading \{#downloading}
The latest version of Open Ticket is available on [**GitHub**](https://www.github.com/open-discord-bots/open-ticket). We recommend downloading from the **official repository** to ensure you're using a secure and up-to-date version.  

You can download Open Ticket in two ways:
#### 1️⃣ Download as a ZIP file <C color="green">(recommended)</C> \{#downloading-zip}
- Visit the [**Open Ticket Github Repository**](https://otgithub.dj-dj.be)
- Click the green **"Code"** button on GitHub and select **"Download ZIP"**.
- Extract the ZIP file to a folder on your computer.
- Open your code editor in the extracted folder (where `index.js` is located).
<ScaleImage src="/img/installation/download.png" alt="Open Ticket Github Repository" size="40%"/>

#### 2️⃣ Clone the repository <C color="red">(not recommended)</C> \{#downloading-clone}
```bash
git clone https://github.com/open-discord-bots/open-ticket.git
cd open-ticket
```

### 📦 Installing Dependencies \{#dependencies}

Before running Open Ticket, you need to install the required npm packages.  

1. Open a terminal or command prompt in the **Open Ticket** folder (where `index.js` is located).  
2. Run the following command to install all necessary dependencies:  
```bash
npm install
```  

### ⚙️ Choosing a JavaScript Engine \{#engine}
Open Ticket runs on **Node.js** (`v18` or above) but also supports alternative engines like **Deno** and **Bun**.  
<C color="green">**You can skip this section if you're using an external hosting provider or dashboard.**</C>

:::warning recommended engine  
Bun & Deno are **not officially supported** by Open Ticket. Use them at your own risk!  
If you're new to this, we strongly suggest using **Node.js**, as it's the default and most supported option.  
:::  

#### 🔗 Download the engine of your choice: \{#engine-choice}
<LinkBlock mode="image" image="/img/logo/nodejs.png" isdoc="false" url="https://nodejs.org/en/download" name="Node.js Downloads" description="Install Node.js (v18 or higher) (Recommended)"></LinkBlock>  
<LinkBlock mode="image" image="/img/logo/bun.png" isdoc="false" url="https://bun.sh" name="Bun Downloads" description="Install Bun (Faster, but experimental)"></LinkBlock>  
<LinkBlock mode="image" image="/img/logo/deno.svg" isdoc="false" url="https://deno.com" name="Deno Downloads" description="Install Deno (More secure, but unofficial)"></LinkBlock>  

Once you've installed your engine, you're ready to **configure Open Ticket**! 🚀

## 🤖 Creating Your Discord Bot \{#bot}
Before using Open Ticket, you need to create a **Discord bot**. This bot will act as the bridge between your server and Open Ticket, allowing users to create and manage tickets.  

### 🛠️ Creating The Bot \{#bot-creation}
1. Go to the **[Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)**.  
2. Click **"New Application"** and give your bot a name.  
3. Navigate to the **"Bot"** section and click **"Add Bot"**.  
4. Copy the **bot token**—you will need this later to start Open Ticket.  

<ScaleImage src="/img/installation/devportal-create.png" alt="Discord Developer Portal" size="50%"/>  

:::security token safety
**NEVER EVER** share a Discord token! With the bot token a hacker could control your entire bot!<br></br>
<C color="red">**DJdj Development will never ask for your bot token!**</C>

#### 🚨 Possible Concequences:
- Your server could get raided.
- Users can get roles they shouldn't have access to.
- Messages in restricted channels can be logged.
- Users could get mass-banned.
- And much more...

#### 🔐 Protecting your token:
- Never send a token in DM or server.
- Never upload a token to GitHub. Use the `.env` file instead!
- Don't share the token between multiple users.
- Make sure the token isn't included when you send the `general.json` to someone who wants to help you.

### ✋ Enabling Privileged Intents \{#bot-intents}
Discord requires bots to **enable certain intents** to access specific data, such as messages and member updates.  
<C color="red">**Without these, some features of Open Ticket will not work.**</C>

1. In the Developer Portal, go to your bot’s **"Privileged Gateway Intents"** section.  
2. Enable the required intents.  
3. Save your changes.  

#### Required Intents: \{#bot-intents-list}
- **Message Content Intent** (Required for transcripts & text commands)
- **Server Members Intent** (Required for user management, participants & roles)
- **Presence Intent** (Optional, only used by plugins)

<ScaleImage src="/img/installation/devportal-intents.png" alt="Configure the correct Discord Bot intents" size="80%"/>

### 🔐 Setting Bot Permissions \{#bot-permissions}
When inviting your bot to your Discord server, you need to grant it <C color="blue">**sufficient permissions**</C> to function properly.  
Insufficient permissions could result in weird errors and glitches.
 
For the best experience, we <C color="green">**highly recommend**</C> granting your bot the **`Administrator`** permission.
This ensures the bot has all the access it needs without running into issues.  

If you prefer a more restrictive setup, you can [**manually configure permissions**](./02-installation/03-permissions.mdx), but be aware that missing certain permissions might break some features.  

*Once you've completed these steps, your bot is ready to be added to your server! 🚀*

<ScaleImage src="/img/installation/devportal-permissions.png" alt="Configure the correct Discord Bot permissions" size="80%"/>

## 👋 Inviting The Bot \{#bot-invite}
Once your bot is set up, you need to invite it to your Discord server using an OAuth2 URL which can be found below the permissions.
Copy the generated invite link and open it in your browser. Select your server and click Authorize.

<ScaleImage src="/img/installation/devportal-invite.png" alt="Copy the OAuth2 URL of your Discord Bot" size="80%"/>

*Your bot should now appear in your server! 🎉*

## ⚙ Configuration \{#config}
Open Ticket is fully configurable using <C color="blue">**five JSON config files**</C>.
Each file controls a different aspect of the bot, allowing you to customize everything from ticket options to panel layouts.
Here’s a breakdown of each config file and what they do:  

### 💼 [`config/general.json`](/docs/reference/config/general.mdx) – General Bot Settings \{#config-general}

- Each question is shown in a form (modal) before ticket creation.

📌 *After configuring a panel, use the `/panel` command to send it to a channel!*  

### [📂 `config/transcripts.json`](/docs/reference/config/transcripts.mdx) – Transcript Settings \{#config-transcripts}
This file controls **how ticket transcripts are saved** when a ticket is deleted.  
- Choose between **HTML or text transcripts**.  
- Customize the **transcript layout, colors, and format**.  
- Transcripts are disabled by default.

📌 *Transcripts let you keep a record of past tickets for future reference!*

## 🚀 Testing \{#testing}
Now that you've configured the bot, it's time to run it and test if everything works as expected!  

### ▶ Starting the Bot \{#starting-bot}
Run the following command to start Open Ticket:  
```bash title="Start using npm (recommended)"
npm start
```
