# ❌ Config Errors
<FlexHorizontal>
<div style={{width:"50%"}} className="otdocs-flex-mobile-width">
Configuring Open Ticket should be easy, but sometimes a tiny mistake can cause big headaches.  
That’s where the <C color="blue">**Config Checker 🦸‍♂️**</C> comes in!

If something in your configuration files isn’t quite right, Open Ticket will scan for errors and display them in a structured table before shutting down. This ensures that everything is properly set up before the bot starts running.

This guide will help you understand the system and how to fix the most common config errors.

## ❓ About Config Errors \{#about}
Open Ticket validates **all configuration files**, including those from **plugins**, to prevent invalid settings from breaking the bot. The built-in **Config Checker** uses a predefined scheme to verify every property and value. If an issue is detected, it will be displayed in the console along with helpful details on what went wrong.  

Here’s how it works:  
1. **Scans all config files** (including plugin configs).  
2. **Checks for missing or incorrect values** based on expected formats.  
3. **Displays errors in a structured format** before aborting the startup.

*📌 This way, you can easily spot and fix any issues **before the bot even runs**!*

## 🤔 Typical Config Issues \{#known-issues}
Some of the most common mistakes detected by the **Config Checker** include:  

- **Non-unique ID** → This id is already used somewhere else, use another one instead.
- **Invalid ID** → The provided ID does not match the expected format. (`A-Z`, `a-z`, `0-9`, `_` & `-`)
- **Invalid category, channel, user, or role ID** → The ID is syntactically invalid. This is not related to the existence of this ID.
- **String must be shorter/longer than ... characters** → A text value exceeds the allowed length.  
- **The property ... is missing from this object** → A required field is missing in your config. Try to compare your config with the original one.
- **This string can only be one of the following values: ...** → The provided value is invalid and must match a predefined list.  

 *📌 If you run into a config error, don’t panic! The solution is usually as simple as **double-checking IDs, fixing typos, or ensuring all required properties are included**.*
