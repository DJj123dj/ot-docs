Hi there! We are still working on this guide. In the meantime, you can always join our [**discord server**](https://discord.dj-dj.be) for questions related to <C color="blue">**pelican panels**</C>.

We are still working on official Open Ticket eggs. They should be available soon! You can always use the default `node.js` pelican egg.
