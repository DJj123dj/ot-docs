## ✅ Starting Open Ticket
Once PM2 is installed, <C color="red">**navigate to your Open Ticket folder**</C> and start the bot using PM2:
```sh
pm2 start npm --name="<bot-name>" -- start
```

#### 📌 Explanation:
- `pm2 start npm` → Runs an npm script using PM2.
- `--name="<bot-name>"` → Assigns a name to the process (you can change this).
- `-- start` → Runs the `start` script from Open Ticket’s `package.json`.

To verify that the bot is running, use:
```sh
pm2 list
```
If everything is correct, you should see Open Ticket in the process list.

## 💡 Managing PM2 Processes
Once Open Ticket is running with PM2, you can control it with various commands.

### ▶️ Start or Restart the Bot
If the bot is stopped or crashes, restart it with:

pm2 restart <bot-name>
```

If you need to start it again after stopping:
```sh
pm2 start <bot-name>
```

### ⏹️ Stop or Delete the Bot
To temporarily stop the bot:
```sh
pm2 stop <bot-name>
```

To completely remove it from PM2:
```sh
pm2 delete <bot-name>
```

### 📜 Viewing Logs
If something isn’t working, check the logs with:
```sh
pm2 logs <bot-name>
```

You can also view real-time logs:
```sh
pm2 monit
```

### 🔄 Auto-Restart on Server Reboot
To ensure Open Ticket starts automatically when your VPS reboots, run:
```sh
pm2 startup
```

This will generate a command that you need to copy and run. Then, save your process list so that it restarts after reboot:
```sh
pm2 save
```
