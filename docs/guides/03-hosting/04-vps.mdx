## ✅ Starting Open Ticket \{#startup}
Once PM2 is installed, <C color="red">**navigate to your Open Ticket folder**</C> and start the bot using PM2:
```sh
pm2 start npm --name="<bot-name>" -- start
```

#### 📌 Explanation \{#explaination}
- `pm2 start npm` → Runs an npm script using PM2.
- `--name="<bot-name>"` → Assigns a name to the process (you can change this).
- `-- start` → Runs the `start` script from Open Ticket’s `package.json`.

To verify that the bot is running, use:
```sh
pm2 list
```
If everything is correct, you should see Open Ticket in the process list.

pm2 delete <bot-name>
```

### 📜 Viewing Logs \{#pm2-logs-monit}
If something isn’t working, check the logs with:
```sh

### 🔄 Auto-Restart on Server Reboot \{#pm2-auto-start}
