Hi there! We are still working on this guide. In the meantime, you can always join our [**discord server**](https://discord.dj-dj.be) for questions related to <C color="blue">**docker images**</C>.

We are still working on official Open Ticket docker images. They should be available soon! In the meantime, you can always use the temporary `Dockerfile`'s in the repository.
