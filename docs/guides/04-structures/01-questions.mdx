## ❓ What Are Questions? \{#about}
A **question** in Open Ticket is a customizable prompt that users must answer when creating a ticket. Questions allow you to gather relevant information from users before a ticket is submitted, ensuring that staff have all necessary details.  

When a user starts the ticket creation process, all configured questions are displayed in a **Discord modal**, where they can fill in their responses.  

### 🎯 Purpose of Questions \{#about-purpose}
Questions are great for the following purposes:  
- ✅ Collecting information before a ticket is created.  
- ✅ Reducing back-and-forth by gathering essential details upfront.  
- ✅ Ensuring users provide structured input, improving support efficiency.

:::tip advanced questions
If you need more and complexer questions, we recommend the [**OT Ticket Forms Plugin**](https://github.com/DJj123dj/open-discord-plugins/tree/main/open-ticket/ot-ticket-forms).
It can also provide multiple choice and dropdown questions.

## 📍 Where Are Questions Used? \{#usage}
Questions are **defined in the `questions.json` file** and are referenced in the **`options.json`** config.  
To use a question, its **`id`** must be added to the `"questions"` array in `options.json`.  

- **File:** `questions.json` → Defines all available questions.  
- **File:** `options.json` → Determines which questions are used in tickets.

## 🎨 Customization Options \{#customisation}
Questions in Open Ticket can be **fully customized** to match your needs. Here are some key customization options:  
- **Input Types** – Choose between a **short** single-line input or a **paragraph** for longer responses.  
- **Required or Optional** – Decide if a question must be answered before creating a ticket.  
- **Placeholders** – Provide example text inside the input field to guide users.  
- **Character Limits** – Set minimum and maximum lengths for responses.  

### 💡 Best Practices \{#best-practises}
✔️ Use **clear and concise** question names.  
✔️ Set `"required": true` only for **important** questions.  
✔️ Avoid excessive `"length"` limits that may frustrate users.  
✔️ Use `"placeholder"` to guide users on how to answer.
