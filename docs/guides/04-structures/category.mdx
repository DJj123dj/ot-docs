# 🏗️ Structures  
In this section, we will explain the core building blocks of Open Ticket, such as <C color="blue">**questions, options, and panels**</C>. Everything within Open Ticket is built around these 3 structures. It's important that you know what they do, what you can customise and where you use them.
