## 📌 What Are Actions? \{#about}
Ticket actions are **commands and buttons** that allow users to manage tickets efficiently. Whether you're **closing**, **deleting**, **claiming** or **managing users**, these actions help keep your ticket system organized and functional.

Ticket actions are typically used by **staff members and administrators** to manage tickets based on their current status and purpose.  

### 🎯 Ticket Action Purpose \{#about-purpose}
Ticket actions help with:  
- ✅ Keeping tickets **organized** by renaming, moving, and pinning.  
- ✅ Ensuring proper **ticket lifecycle management** (closing, reopening, deleting).  
- ✅ Controlling **user access** by adding or removing participants.  
- ✅ Automating ticket behavior with **auto-close and auto-delete**.
