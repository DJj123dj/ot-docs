# 📄 Transcripts

<div style={{width:"50%"}} className="otdocs-flex-mobile-width">
Hello there! Welcome to the <C color="blue">**Transcripts Guide**</C> for Open Ticket.

Transcripts allow you to **save and review past ticket conversations** after they have been **deleted**.
Open Ticket provides multiple ways to store and access these transcripts, making it easy to keep a record of tickets.  

This guide will cover what transcripts are, how to use them, and the <C color="green">**differences between HTML and text transcripts.**</C>

## 📌 What Are Transcripts? \{#about}
Transcripts are **saved records of ticket conversations** that allow server admins and users to review past discussions. This is useful for:  
- **Support history** – Reviewing previous tickets for recurring issues.  
- **Moderation** – Keeping logs of user reports and rule enforcement.  
- **Training** – Helping staff learn how previous tickets were handled.  

### ⚙️ How Are Transcripts Saved? \{#types}
Open Ticket supports two transcript formats:  
- **HTML Transcripts <C color="green">(recommended)</C>** – A visually structured, styled version with message formatting.  
- **Text Transcripts** – A simple text-based log of the conversation.  

Transcripts can be <C color="blue">**automatically sent to specific Discord channels, ticket creators, or admins**</C> based on your config.

</FlexHorizontal>

### ❓ How to Use Transcripts? \{#usage}
By default, Open Ticket automatically **creates transcripts when a ticket is <C color="red">deleted</C>**. These transcripts can be:  
- **Sent to a Discord channel** (for staff records).  
- **DM’d to the ticket creator and participants** (so they have a copy).

### 📤 Manually Generating Transcripts \{#manual}
:::experimental unimplemented
This feature is currently unimplemented but will be added in a future version!

## 🌐 HTML Transcripts \{#html-transcripts}
HTML transcripts provide a **structured, visually enhanced** record of the ticket conversation, similar to how messages appear in Discord.
They will also contain **embeds, buttons, dropdowns, reactions** and other additional elements from the ticket.

:::deprecated Open Ticket v4 features
Because the HTML Transcripts v2 were developed before Open Ticket v4, a lot of new features like <C color="blue">**questions, improved stats & plugins**</C> are currently not supported in the transcripts.
They will be <C color="red">**added in the next version**</C> of HTML Transcripts which will release somewhere this year.
:::

#### 🖥️ Where Are HTML Transcripts Hosted? \{#html-hosted}
HTML transcripts are processed and stored at `https://transcripts.dj-dj.be`.  
- <C color="red">**This cannot be changed in the current version (`v2`).**</C>  
- <C color="green">**It WILL be customizable in the upcoming version (`v3`).**</C>  
- <C color="blue">**The transcript compiler is closed-source, so transcripts will always be processed on our servers.**</C>  
- Custom domains **will** be a paid feature. For more info join our [**discord server**](https://discord.dj-dj.be)!

## 🎨 Customisation \{#customisation}
Transcripts can be **customized** in the `transcripts.json` config to match your server’s needs. HTML Transcripts have a lot more customisation options than text transcripts.

<LinkBlock mode="emoji" emoji="📄" url="/docs/reference/config/transcripts" isdoc="true" name="transcripts.json (Transcript Config)" description="Configure everything related to ticket transcripts. Both HTML & text are available!"/>

### 📄 Customising Text Transcripts \{#customisation-text}
Text transcripts support settings such as:  
- **Layout** – Choose between `"simple"`, `"normal"`, or `"detailed"`.  
- **Include/exclude certain data** – Choose whether to include statistics, user IDs, embeds, or file attachments.  

### 🌐 Customising HTML Transcripts \{#customisation-html}
While HTML transcripts are processed externally, you can still configure:  
- **Background Color & Image**.
- **Stats & Header Colors**.
- Choose a **custom favicon**.
- <C color="blue">**And 10x more coming in the upcoming `v3`!**</C>

### 🔍 Transcript Type Differences \{#customisation-diff}
| Feature               | Text Transcript | HTML Transcript  |
|----------------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Readability**      | Basic text file | Styled, visual format |
| **File format**      | `.txt` | `URL` |
| **Searchable?**      | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| **Hosted online?**   | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (on Open Ticket servers) |
| **Includes embeds?** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **Extensive Stats?**   | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **Includes all details?**   | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **Includes images?** | ❌ No | 🟠 Partially |
| **Contains credits?**   | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |

:::tip
Use HTML transcripts if you need a more readable and structured log. Text transcripts are better for lightweight storage and automation or if you don't want to see credits 😉.

## ⚠️ HTML Errors & Reliability \{#errors-readability}
The HTML Transcript servers are <C color="red">**almost never down or affected by an outage.**</C> But it is never impossible.

Occasionally, errors may occur when generating HTML transcripts, such as when the HTML Transcripts servers are down or if something goes wrong during transcript creation. Open Ticket provides several options to handle these situations:

<ScaleImage src="/img/docs-v4/transcript-error.png" size="70%" alt="An example of a HTML Transcripts error message."></ScaleImage>  

### 💥 What Happens During Errors? \{#errors-about}
When an error occurs, the bot will notify you with a message that includes the following options:

1. <C color="green">**Retry**</C> – Attempts to regenerate the transcript and will eventually delete the ticket like normal.
2. <C color="blue">**Create Backup Transcript (Coming Soon)**</C> – Creates a **text-based backup** of the ticket conversation.
3. <C color="red">**Delete Ticket Without Transcript**</C> – Closes the ticket and deletes it, **without generating or storing any transcript**.  

This ensures that even if something goes wrong, you’re not left without a way to keep track of important conversations.
The bot will most of the time also provide a clear message explaining the problem.

:::info ticket deletion
When you receive this notification, the ticket **deletion process** will be **canceled** and the ticket is still available like normal.
