# üë• Reaction Roles
<FlexHorizontal>
<div style={{width:"50%"}} className="otdocs-flex-mobile-width">
Hello there! Welcome to <C color="blue">**Reaction Roles**</C> guide for Open Ticket.
Reaction roles allow you to assign roles to users based on their reactions to a message.
This feature was **added to the bot after requests from the community**, and it‚Äôs now an integral part of the bot.

Reaction roles are an interactive way to allow users to assign themselves roles by reacting to a message. Instead of opening tickets, <C color="green">**users can select roles in panel buttons.**</C>

## üë• About Reaction Roles \{#about}
In Open Ticket, **reaction roles** are defined using the `"role"` option type within your [`options.json` configuration file](/docs/reference/config/options.mdx#reaction-role-properties). Instead of creating tickets, when a user reacts to a specific message, they are assigned or removed roles depending on the configuration.

</FlexHorizontal>

### üîß Configuration \{#configuration}
You can create **reaction roles** like any other **option** in the bot. Take a look at the example provided in the default [`options.json`](/docs/reference/config/options.mdx#example-file).

There are many things you can customise, including:
- **roles** - Choose which roles you want to add or remove.
- **mode** - Choose how the user will interact with the button.
- **remove on add** - Provide additional roles to be removed when roles are added. 
- **add on join** - Automatically add these roles when someone joins the server.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations & Recommendations \{#limitations-recommendations}
While reaction roles provide a great deal of flexibility, keep in mind that:
- <C color="red">**Open Ticket is a Ticket Bot**</C>, its only purpose is managing tickets. This feature will ofcourse not be as advanced as in other multi-purpose bots.
- Reaction roles do not work in **dropdown based panels**! This might still be added in a future version of Open Ticket.
- Please do not use **reaction roles and tickets** in the same panel. It will result in a bad user experience.
