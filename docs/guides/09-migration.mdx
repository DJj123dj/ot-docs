# 🔀 Migrating From Open Ticket v3

<div style={{width:"50%"}} className="otdocs-flex-mobile-width">
Welcome to the guide about <C color="blue">**migrating**</C> from Open Ticket v3 to Open Ticket v4.

Since Open Ticket v4 is a **complete rewrite**, **the database & config from v3 is <C color="red">not compatible</C> with v4.**
This guide will help you **transition smoothly** while keeping as much of your data as possible.

We try to make this process as user-friendly as possible, but all migrated tickets will sadly enough still have limited functionality.
The full v4 experience is only available with newly created tickets.

## 📂 Creating A Backup \{#backup}
Before you start, **back up your existing v3 setup** to a safe location to ensure you don’t lose anything:
- `config.json`, `transcriptconfig.json`, `./storage/`
- Open Ticket v3 plugins won't work in Open Ticket v4 anymore

<Divider></Divider>
## 🔄 Migrating to Open Ticket v4 \{#migrating}
### 1️⃣ Install Open Ticket v4 \{#step1-install}
- Download the latest version of Open Ticket v4 from **[GitHub](https://otgithub.dj-dj.be)**.  
- Follow the **[Setup Guide](/docs/guides/01-get-started.mdx)** to install it.  
- Run `npm install` to install all required dependencies.  

### 2️⃣ Convert Configuration Files \{#step2-config}
Since v4 **completely changes** how configuration works, you **cannot** reuse `config.json` and `transcriptconfig.json`.  
Instead, manually **recreate** your settings in the new config folder:
- **General settings** → Moved to `./config/general.json`
- **Options** → Moved to `./config/options.json`
- **Panels/Messages** → Moved to `./config/panels.json`
- **Transcript settings** → Moved to `./config/transcripts.json`
- **Ticket questions <C color="green">(NEW)</C>** → Available in `./config/questions.json`  

If you're stuck, try reading the **[Configuration Guide](/docs/guides/02-installation/02-configuration.mdx)** for more details.

### 3️⃣ Migrate Tickets (Optional) \{#step3-tickets}

To transfer old tickets from v3 to v4, you can use the **OT Migrate v3** plugin. When starting the bot, all tickets will receive a message with the associated instructions.

Ticket migration is **limited**. Some features **will sadly enough not** transfer correctly, and migrated tickets will have **reduced functionality**.

## 🛠️ Downloading Plugins \{#plugins}
**Open Ticket v3 plugins are NOT compatible with v4.** You'll have to download all v4 versions from the official plugin repository.

Check the Official Open Ticket Plugins repository for v4-compatible plugins:
