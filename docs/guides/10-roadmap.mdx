# üó∫Ô∏è Public Roadmap
<FlexHorizontal>
<div style={{width:"50%"}} className="otdocs-flex-mobile-width">
The Open Ticket Public Roadmap gives you a clear view of upcoming features, ongoing work, and future plans.
We aim to implement every feature request, as long as it's viable and useful.

If a request is too specific or too large, we try make it available through plugins instead.

*Open Ticket has always been built on the idea of being the <C color="blue">**most advanced Discord ticket bot ever**</C>, and we continue to push that goal forward with every update. üöÄ*

Not all listed ideas on the roadmap will be implemented in the bot. Some of them will be concepts forever or might eventually be removed.
Also note that this is not the full roadmap. There's also a private roadmap which contains even more features & details.

If you ever have a suggestion, feel free to post it in our [**discord server**](https://discord.dj-dj.be)!

    - `allowCloseBeforeAdminMessage` option to disable closing the ticket when nothing has been sent in the ticket yet by an admin.
- **Pin Ticket Message** - Let's go back to Open Ticket v3! Add the `pinTicketMessage` option to pin the ticket message.
- **Autodelete After Close** - Adds `"autodeleteRequiresClosedTicket"`. When enabled, autodelete only works when a ticket has been closed.

### üé® Customisability \{#small-customisability}
- **Native Footer Images** - no more plugins needed!

- **Fields & Questions** - `allowFieldsWithQuestions` option to allow fields while an option contains questions that are displayed in the embed fields.

### üòÑ User Friendliness \{#small-friendliness}
- **Autocomplete Ids** - Instead of slash commands using 'choices' for panel & ticket ids, use the interaction autocomplete feature!

### ‚öôÔ∏è Plugins & API \{#small-plugins}
- **Silent Mode** - A new flag called `--silent` to reduce the amount of logs sent to the console. It will show the startscreen directly.
- **Translation Checker** - Built-in config checker for translations.
- **Updated `plugin.json`** -
     - **Multiple Authors** - Allow multiple plugin authors & contributors. The old author(`string`) field should still work to keep backwards compatibility.
     - **Versions** - A list of compatible versions for the plugin to work with (e.g. `OTv4.0.x`, `OTv4.1.x`, `OTv4.0.0`, `ODv1.0.0`, ... the letters in the beginning specify the project: OT, OD, OM, OU) 
     - **Read Before TSC** - Read the `plugin.json` from all plugins before doing TS compilation & search for required `npm dependencies` (auto download?)
