The Open Ticket Public Roadmap gives you a clear view of upcoming features, ongoing work, and future plans.
We aim to implement every feature request, as long as it's viable and useful.

If a request is too specific or too large, we try make it available through plugins instead.

*Open Ticket has always been built on the idea of being the <C color="blue">**most advanced Discord ticket bot ever**</C>, and we continue to push that goal forward with every update. üöÄ*

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap \{#roadmap}
### üü¢ Minor Ideas
- **Remote Opening** - Open a ticket for another user using `/ticket <user>`.
- **Reopen Autoclose** - Disable autoclose when the ticket got reopened.
- **Custom status state** - Set the `"state"` text of the custom status.
- **Timed Blacklist** - Blacklist someone temporarily for a few hours.
- **More Stats** - Yep, even more statistics.
- **Translation Checker** - Built-in config checker for translations.
- **Claim remove admins** - `removeAdminsOnClaim` option to remove all other admins when a ticket is claimed.
    - allow global admin read
    - allow global admin write
    - allow ticket admin read
    - allow ticket admin write
- **Close Limits** - Enforce new limits for ticket closing + deletion
    - `allowCloseBeforeCreatorMessage` option to disable closing the ticket when nothing has been sent in the ticket yet.
    - `allowCloseBeforeAdminMessage` option to disable closing the ticket when nothing has been sent in the ticket yet by an admin.
- **Pin Ticket Message** - Let's go back to Open Ticket v3! Add the `pinTicketMessage` option to pin the ticket message.
