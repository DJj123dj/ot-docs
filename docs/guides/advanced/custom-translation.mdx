In Open Ticket, you can use your own custom translation! This is perfect if your language doesn't exist in <InlineLink isdoc="true" url="docs/translation">**the existing ones**</InlineLink>!
To create your own translation, follow the steps in this tutorial!

## Edit `custom.json` \{#edit}
The first step is to edit the `./language/custom.json` file. Here, you can edit all sentences used in embeds & commands from the bot.
You can set the `"_CREDITS"` property to your own name! If you want, you can even **send the file to us so that we can create an official language of it!**

:::warning structure & filename
Please keep the structure of the file like it is! Don't move, delete & add any variables to the file!
Also don't rename the file, because it won't work anymore!
:::

## Configure `config.json` \{#configure}
To finish the custom translation, set the `"languageFile"` property to `"custom"` in config.json!
