Open Ticket uses a JSON database in the directory `./storage/`. It's used to store ticket data & stats.
In open ticket v3, <C color="blue">**it's not much of a problem when the database gets broken/reset**</C>. This is because most of the data stored in there isn't super important!
:::warning open ticket 4.0
In Open Ticket v4, it will be important to keep your database when you update! This is because OT v4 will use the database to store much more information about a ticket. This will be used for plugins & other features!
:::

## The databases \{#list}
`./storage/database.json`:
- Used for storing ticket data (creator, date, version, type, id,...)

`./storage/stats.json`:
- Used for storing stats (global, ticket & user)

## Resetting the databases \{#reset}
To reset/clear the database, you can just delete the files `./storage/database.json` & `./storage/stats.json`.
It's recommended to do this **when you don't have any tickets currently**!
