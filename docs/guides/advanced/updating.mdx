To update Open Ticket to a new version, you need to follow a few steps! If you don't follow these, you might lose some important data or settings. And let's not forget about unknown errors!

## STEP 1: Stop the bot \{#step-1}
Before starting, stop the bot & wait until it's completely offline. Then you can continue to the next step!

## STEP 2: Collect old data \{#step-2}
Collect all old data from the bot. The data can be used again in the updated bot, this way you don't have to reconfigure everything!
**The files that you need to keep are:**
- `./config.json`
- `./transcriptconfig.json`
- `./storage/database.json`
- `./storage/stats.json`
- `./plugins/...` (all plugins)

## STEP 3: Install the new version \{#step-3}
Download & install a new version of the bot like you already did before! **Visit this page for more information:**

## STEP 4: Check the changelog \{#step-4}
**Check the changelog or update announcement to know what changed.** By reading these, you can find out what changed compared to the previous version.

If you skip one or more version, it's best to also check their changelog for extra info!

## STEP 5: Configure the config \{#step-5}
Now you can copy-paste some parts of the old config to the new config. <C color="red">**But remember what has been changed from the changelog!**</C>
Repeat this process until you have the entire config moved over!

Do this for `config.json` & `transcriptconfig.json`!

## STEP 6: Insert database files \{#step-6}
The last thing you need to do is add the old database files (`./storage/database.json` & `./storage/stats.json`) back to the `./storage/` directory!
