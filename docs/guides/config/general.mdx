import {C,M,ScaleImage,LinkBlock,InlineLink,FlexHorizontal} from "@site/src/components/openticket.jsx"

These are the main settings or the most important ones. You can find them at the top of your `config.json` file.
They include the main color for embeds, the server ID, the bot token & more!
In the code block below, you can find some notes about what every variable does!

```json title="config.json"
"color":"#f8ba00", //the main embed color
"serverId":"12345678910", //your server id
"token":{
    "value":"insert your bot token here", //your bot token
    "fromENV":false //load your token from the ENV
},
"adminRoles":["role id 1","role id 2"], //the role ids from your admin team (splitted by comma's)
"prefix":"!ticket ", //the prefix for text-based commands (does not apply to slash commands)
"languageFile":"english", //select one of the available languages (visit the ./language/ folder)
```

### "color" (hex color) \{#color}
This is the **main color** of the bot. It's used in almost every embed!
The color is written in hex, if you need help with this, you can always visit [Encycolorpedia](https://www.encycolorpedia.com)!
**Just remember to put a `#` in-front of the code!**

- Default value: `#ffffff` (white)
- Allowed values: `"#hex color"`
- Required: `false`
- Type: `string`

### "serverId" (server id) \{#serverid}
Here, you need to put the id of the discord server that the bot is in. This id will be used to create **slash commands & save data**!

- Default value: `""` (empty)
- Allowed values: `"server id"`
- Required: `true`
- Type: `string`

### "token/value" (bot token) \{#token-value}
This is <C color="red">**the password of your bot**</C>. It allows open ticket to communicate with discord!

- Default value: `""` (empty)
- Allowed values: `"bot token"`
- Required: `true`
- Type: `string`

:::danger token safety
**NEVER EVER** share your discord token! If someone can get your token, he can nuke your entire discord server!
#### Here are some tips for protecting your token:
- never send your token to someone
- when uploading the bot to github, make sure the token isn't sent with it
- get the token from the `.env` file
- when sending your `config.json` to someone for help, make sure the token isn't sent with it
:::

### "token/fromENV" (boolean) \{#token-env}
Enable this boolean to <C color="red">**get the bot token from the `.env` file instead of the `"value":"..."`**</C>.
When using this, you can leave the `"value"` empty! Oh, and here is an example of a `.env` file:
```toml title=".env"
TOKEN=your-token-here
```

- Default value: `false`
- Allowed values: `true` or `false`
- Required: `false`
- Type: `boolean`

### "adminRoles" (role id list) \{#adminroles}
The `"adminRoles"` variable is a list of all **global admin role id's**! Roles inside this list can:
- ‚úÖ read in every ticket
- ‚úÖ write in every ticket
- ‚úÖ use commands in every ticket
- ‚úÖ use buttons in every ticket

**‚ö†Ô∏è Only use this for roles that are allowed to have full power over the bot!**

- Default value: `[]` (empty)
- Allowed values: `["role id 1","role id 2","role id 3",...]`
- Required: `false`
- Type: `string array`

### "prefix" (string) \{#prefix}
This is **the prefix for all text commands** in the bot, so it won't be used for slash commands!
<br></br>Here are some examples:
|prefix                   |help command      |close command              |
|-------------------------|------------------|---------------------------|
|`!ticket` (with space)   |`!ticket help`    |`!ticket close <reason>`   |
|`?`                      |`?help`           |`?close <reason>`          |
|`!ot`                    |`!othelp`         |`!otclose <reason>`        |


- Default value: `!ticket` (with space at the end)
- Allowed values: `max length: 20 characters`
- Required: `false`
- Type: `string`

### "languageFile" (valid language) \{#languagefile}
The language file decides what **language** the bot will use!
When you set the language, all embeds & messages from the bot are translated into this language!

**‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure you write the language in lowercase!**
