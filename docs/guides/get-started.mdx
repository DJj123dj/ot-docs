:::info Discord Bot Knowledge
It is highly recommended that you know some **basic principles** about `discord bots` & `node.js` before working with Open Ticket!
This documentation won't explain how to create your bot or how to write javascript, but we will provide some basic info about hosting this bot on different platforms.
:::

## Installation
You can install Open Ticket from [github](https://www.github.com/DJj123dj/open-ticket) by **cloning** or **downloading it as a ZIP file**. We recommend downloading it from the official repository, because other versions may be modified! When downloading as a ZIP file, you need to extract it ofcourse!

### Npm Packages
Open Ticket needs some npm packages to work! You can install them all at once with `npm install`
If you prefer to do it manually, you can use:
```text title="Manual Installation"
npm install discord.js axios chalk
```

### Engine
To run Open Ticket, you can use `node.js`, `deno` or `bun`. <C color="blue">**If you are a beginner, it's recommended to use `node.js`!**</C>

**You can install them here:**
:::warning
Be aware that Bun & Deno are not officially supported by Open Ticket. Use them at your own risk!

## Bot Setup
### creation
Before you can use Open Ticket, you need to create a discord bot! You can create one at the [discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications). Open Ticket also needs some **permissions** & **intents** to function properly. These need to be configured in the discord developer portal!
<ScaleImage src="/img/docs-v3/installation/devportal_create.png" alt="Image of Discord developer portal" size="50%"/>

### permissions
When inviting your bot to a discord server, we recommend giving your bot the `ADMINISTRATOR` permission!
It is also possible to define your own permissions, but it can affect the bot's ability to do some things.

More info can be found here:
<LinkBlock mode="emoji" emoji="‚úÖ" url="/docs/guides/system/installation-permissions" name="Installation Permissions" description="Everything about bot permissions!"></LinkBlock>

### intents
Every discord bot also needs some **Privileged Gateaway Intents**.
These intents give the bot some extra permissions that are required for some features!
The `Message Content Intent` allows the bot to read text messages in the server.
**If you don't enable this, transcripts & text commands won't work!**

## Configuration
Open Ticket has 5 config files! Each of them has their own purpose and it's quite logically ordered.
- `config/general.json` (Bot configuration: token, color, permissions, ...)
- `config/questions.json` (Questions: the questions to ask before opening a ticket)
- `config/options.json` (Options: the options/ticket types you have available in the bot)
- `config/panels.json` (Panels: the panels/embeds you have available in the bot)
- `config/transcripts.json` (Transcript configuration: html, text, layout, ...)

:::tip
You can find an advanced explanation for all config variables **<InlineLink url="/docs/guides/config" isdoc="true">here</InlineLink>**!
:::

### General Settings
These are the general settings and the most important ones. You can find them in `config/general.json`.
They're primarily for important variables like the main color for embeds, the server ID, the bot token, command permissions & more!

You're able to add these questions to an `option` for it to be asked before the ticket is created.

You're able to create an **infinite** amount of questions. Every question can be configured with it's own settings, limits, name, placeholders & more!

<LinkBlock mode="emoji" emoji="‚öô" url="/docs/guides/config/questions" name="How to configure config/questions.json?" description="Question Configuration: the modal questions available in the bot."></LinkBlock>

:::warning frequent mistake
To create multiple questions, you need to copy everything **<C color="yellow">between & together with the `{...}` brackets</C>**!
Then, you need to paste it **<C color="yellow">behind the original one</C>**, but separate it with a comma!
Make sure that they don't have the same ID or the bot will give an error!

<C color="red">**Many people fail to copy-paste it correctly! Make sure to follow the instructions clearly!**</C>
:::

If you are ready with the questions, you can move on to the **[Option Settings](#option-settings)** below for creating buttons!

### Option Settings (buttons) \{#option-settings}
These are the option settings. You can find them in `config/options.json`.
You can compare an `option` with a <C color="blue">**button or ticket type**</C>.
There are 3 types: `ticket`, `website` & `role`. The `ticket` option is the most important one.

You're able to create an **infinite** amount of options. Every option can be configured with it's own settings, questions, admins, embeds, button layout & more!

Each time a ticket is deleted, a transcript is created. You can choose if you want to enable them & how they will look.
