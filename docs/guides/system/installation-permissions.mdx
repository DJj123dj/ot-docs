For the bot to work properly, you need **permissions** & **gateaway intents**! Permissions are configured when creating the invite URL. Gateaway Intents configured in the developer portal!

## Invite Permissions
The easiest option is to give the bot the `ADMINISTRATOR` permission. But if you want the must-have permissions, you can use these ones:
- `MANAGE_SERVER`
- `MANAGE_CHANNELS`
- `MANAGE_ROLES`
- `MANAGE_WEBHOOKS`
- `VIEW_CHANNEL`
- `SEND_MESSAGES`
- `SEND_MESSAGES_IN_THREAD`
- `MANAGE_MESSAGES`
- `EMBED_LINKS`
- `ATTACH_FILES`
- `READ_MESSAGE_HISTORY`
- `MENTION_EVERYONE`
- `EXTERNAL_EMOJIS`
- `ADD_REACTIONS`
- `USE_SLASH_COMMANDS`

## Gateaway Intents
The gateaway intents are extra permissions that your bot needs to do some things. **The most important one is `Message Content Intent`**
It's used to read the messages for HTML Transcripts. **It's best to have them all enabled**, because this will reduce the likelyhood of an unexpected error!
