Transcripts are a way of preserving tickets in Open Ticket. You can always look back in the chat & what has been said. Every message is labeled with a timestamp & [HTML Transcripts](#html) have some extra features!
Currently there are 2 types of transcripts in Open Ticket.

- [HTML Transcripts](#html) <C color="green">(online / external)</C>
- [Text Transcripts](#text) <C color="red">(offline / internal)</C>

**To use transcripts, you need to enable & configure them in `transcriptconfig.json`:**
<LinkBlock mode="emoji" emoji="⚙️" isdoc="true" url="docs/config/transcripts" name="transcriptconfig.json" description="Configure Text & HTML Transcripts!"></LinkBlock>

## HTML Transcripts \{#html}
<ScaleImage src="/img/docs-v3/core/transcripts_html.png"></ScaleImage>

HTML Transcripts is the latest revolutionary feature of Open Ticket. You won't find any other bot with such a good transcript system!

### Features \{#html-features}
- **Advanced Customisation**
    - background
    - header
    - stats
- **Message Attachments**
    - files
    - images
    - embeds
- **Message Reactions**
- **Message Components**
    - buttons
    - dropdowns
- **Full Markdown Experience**
    - bold, italic, underline
    - mentions
    - urls
- **Slash Commands & Replies**
- <C color="red">**And so much more...**</C>

### Message \{#html-message}
In the discord channel responsible for the HTML Transcripts, there will be an embed created with a timer of around `15 sec`.
This is because the server doesn't create the HTML Transcripts instantly! They are created in batches using multiple ones together.

When the timer reaches zero, it will show the final embed:

### Hosting \{#html-hosting}
HTML Transcripts are hosted online! You can't download them, but you can take screenshots! If you want to delete the transcript, [please follow this guide](#html-delete)!
When the bot fails to upload the HTML Transcript to the hosting due to an outage, it will create a [Text Transcript](#text) instead!

:::note hosting
The HTML Transcripts are processed on `https://apis.dj-dj.be`. Then they are sent to `https://transcripts.dj-dj.be/...` for display!

<C color="red">**Currently, CUSTOM DOMAINS are not supported! They will arrive in the future!**</C>

### Deletion \{#html-delete}
If you want to **delete a HTML Transcript**, you first need to join [our discord server](https://discord.dj-dj.be).
Then create a ticket or send a DM to djj123dj. There you can ask for deletion if you meet **at least 2** of the following requirements:
- ✅ You have the URL of the transcript <C color="red">**(required)**</C>
- ✅ You are a participant of the ticket <C color="green">**(recommended)**</C>
- ✅ You are the owner of the bot <C color="green">**(recommended)**</C>
- ✅ You are the owner of the server <C color="green">**(recommended)**</C>
- ✅ The subject of the ticket is about/related to you <C color="green">**(recommended)**</C>

**Why would you want to delete a HTML Transcript?**
- There is sensitive information in the ticket
- There are sensitive images in the ticket
- You just don't like it that there is still a log of your ticket hanging around

:::info auto removal
Once every `6 months`, HTML Transcripts older than `6 months` will be automatically removed! So make sure that you create screenshots from the transcript if you still need it!

## Text Transcripts \{#text}
<ScaleImage src="/img/docs-v3/core/transcripts_text.png"></ScaleImage>

**Text Transcripts are the original transcript system of open ticket before HTML Transcripts existed.**
They have been updated a little bit since their introduction, but most of it has stayed the same!

Text Transcripts don't show as much details as the HTML Transcripts, but they don't require a connection to an external server!

### Features \{#text-features}
- **Offline/Internal Processing**
    - no connection to external server needed
    - always a fallback option
- **Simple Layout**
    - Message contents
    - Timestamp
    - Amount of Embeds
    - Amount of Files
- **Download as text file**

### Fallback \{#text-fallback}
Text Transcripts are used as a fallback for [HTML Transcripts](#html). When the bot fails to upload [HTML Transcripts](#html) due to an outage, it will create a Text Transcript instead.
This way, <C color="red">**you will never lose the contents of a ticket**</C> due to a stupid outage!
