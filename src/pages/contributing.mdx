# Contributing
On this page, we will explain how to contribute to this documentation.
This documentation is created using [docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io), a static-site generator built with react & mdx!
<C color="blue">**You don't need to know anything about React to contribute, only Mdown & a little bit of HTML is required!**</C>

The repository of this documentation is hosted on github:
<LinkBlock mode="image" image="/img/logo/github.png" name="Github: DJj123dj/ot-docs" description="The official Open Ticket documentation!" isdoc="false" url="https://www.github.com/djj123dj/ot-docs"></LinkBlock>

You can create a pull request to contribute to the documentation, but be aware that it may be rejected because of the rules! **All the rules & tips can be found in this page!**

# Structure
The documentation is structured into different parts. <C color="red">**The only parts that contributors should edit are the following ones:**</C>
All other files are reserved for the admins from this documentation!

- `./docs/` (documentation)
- `./src/pages/` (extra pages, like this one)

Here you can find even more info about the different parts:

|Name           |Path                |Notes                                                                                                                                                           |
|---------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|User Docs      |`./docs/docs/`      |The main/general documentation. It's for normal users, please explain everything as clearly as possible!                                                        |
|Developer Docs |`./docs/developer/` |The developer documentation. This is for developers only, you can write a little bit more technical in here!                                                    |
|API Reference  |`./docs/api/`       |The API reference for plugins. Try to use as little text as possible & put links to definitions if possible!                                                    |
|Plugin List    |`./docs/plugin/`    |The plugin list. Here you can discover plugins! <C color="orange">**Contributors are only allowed to add plugins to the `other` category!**</C> |
|Blog           |`./blog/`           |The official blog. <C color="green">**You are allowed to create your own articles, but please ask it before doing so!**</C>                     |
|Custom Pages   |`./src/pages/`      |Custom pages. These include "this page", the home page & some other ones. **Don't edit anything here except if it's really needed!**                            |

# Sidebar, Titles & Page Structure
Try to follow the style of the other pages when it comes to naming & styling.
**For Example:** only add an emoji if pages in the same category have an emoji!

**Don't use heading level `1`, `4`, `5` & `6` in pages.** This is because they don't show up in the table of contents & they are most of the time too large or too small!
Here is an example of how a page should look like:

```js title="example.mdx"
---
title: The Page Title
description: The Page Description
keywords: [keyword_a, keyword_b, keyword_c] //page keywords (SEO)
sidebar_position: 1 //(optional) position in sidebar
---
//import custom components
import {C,M,ScaleImage,LinkBlock,InlineLink,FlexHorizontal} from "@site/src/components/openticket.jsx"

//short description of what this page is about
Lorem Ipsum

## First Category \{#custom-id} //the first large heading
Some content here

### Subcategory //a small subcategory
Some extra content here

### Subcategory //a small subcategory
Some extra content here

## Second Category \{#custom-id} //the second large heading
Some content here

### Subcategory //a small subcategory
Some extra content here

### Subcategory //a small subcategory
Some extra content here

## Third Category \{#custom-id} //the third large heading
Some content here

### Subcategory //a small subcategory
Some extra content here

### Subcategory //a small subcategory
Some extra content here
```

# Mdown & Styling
There is a lot of styling available, here we will list some examples!
If you want to use one of these examples, check this page out in the github repository!

I'm normal text<br></br>
**I'm bold text**<br></br>
*I'm italic text*<br></br>
`I'm code text`

There are also a lot of colors. They can be created using the `<C color="...">` component!
**Try to use colors in combination with bold text for better visibility!**

</FlexHorizontal>

When displaying large amounts of data, you can use lists & tables like these:

<FlexHorizontal mode="left">
    <div style={{width:"25%"}}>
    #### Normal List
    - Data A
        - Data A.1
        - Data A.2
    - Data B
        - Data B.1
        - Data B.2
    - Data C
        - Data C.1
        - Data C.2
    </div>

    <div style={{width:"25%"}}>
    #### Numbered List
    1. Data A
        1. Data A.1
        2. Data A.2
    2. Data B
        1. Data B.1
        2. Data B.2
    3. Data C
        1. Data C.1
        2. Data C.2
    </div>

    <div style={{width:"25%"}}>
    #### Mixed List
    1. Data A
        - Data A.1
        - Data A.2
    2. Data B
        - Data B.1
        - Data B.2
    3. Data C
        - Data C.1
        - Data C.2
    </div>

    <div style={{width:"25%"}}>
    #### Checkbox List
    - [x] Data A
        - [x] Data A.1
        - [ ] Data A.2
    - [x] Data B
        - [x] Data B.1
        - [ ] Data B.2
    - [x] Data C
        - [x] Data C.1
        - [ ] Data C.2
    </div>

</FlexHorizontal>

<FlexHorizontal mode="left">
    <div>
    #### Horizontal Table
    |Column 1|Column 2|Column 3|
    |--------|--------|--------|
    |Row 1   |        |        |
    |Row 2   |        |        |
    |Row 3   |        |        |
    </div>
    <div>
    #### Vertical Table
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Row 1</th>
            <td>Column 1</td>
            <td>Column 2</td>
            <td>Column 3</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Row 2</th>
            <td></td>
            <td></td>
            <td></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Row 3</th>
            <td></td>
            <td></td>
            <td></td>
        </tr>

            <td></td>
            <td></td>
            <td></td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    </div>
</FlexHorizontal>

#### Code Blocks
There are also code blocks! You can use them to show data with a little bit syntax-highlighting!
You can customise the language, title & line numbering!

```json
{
    "abc":123,
    "hey":"Hello World!"
}
```
```javascript title="test.js" showLineNumbers
//this is coooooool!
const a = 1
const b = 2
const c = a+b
console.log("hello world",c)
```
```diff title="changelog"
ADDED:
+ something cool
+ very small features
+ a rickroll

REMOVED:
- boring stuff
- old stuff
```

#### Admonitions
Admonitions are special notes that deserve extra attention! You can put any other Mdown inside of them (so you can see them as a sort of container)

:::tip your custom title here
This is the `tip` admonition! Use it for giving tips to users!
:::
:::warning your custom title here
This is the `warning` admonition! Use it for something very important!
:::
:::danger your custom title here
This is the `danger` admonition! Use it for something that is so important that you absolutely need to see it!
:::
:::info your custom title here
This is the `info` admonition! Use it for something that deservers attention, but isn't important!
:::
:::note your custom title here
This is the `note` admonition! This admonition is rarely used! (An alternative for the `info` admonition)
