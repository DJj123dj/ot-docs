# Sidebar, Titles & Page Structure
Try to follow the style of the other pages when it comes to naming & styling.<br></br>
**Example:** Only use an emoji in the page-name when others in the same category also have it.

**Don't use heading level `1`, `5` & `6`.** They are too large/small most of the time and don't show up in the table of contents.
Here is an example of how a page should look like:

```js title="example.mdx"
---
title: The Page Title
description: The Page Description
keywords: [keyword_a, keyword_b, keyword_c] //page keywords (SEO)
sidebar_position: 1 //(optional) position in sidebar
---
<head>
    <link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="/img/logo_vertical.png"/>
</head>
//import custom components
import {C,M,ScaleImage,LinkBlock,InlineLink,FlexHorizontal,Divider,Hex,ApiUrl,ApiBlock} from "@site/src/components/openticket.jsx"

//short description of what this page is about

```

# Markdown & Styling
There is a lot of styling available, here we will list some examples!
If you want to use one of these examples, check this page out in the github repository!

I'm normal text<br></br>
**I'm bold text**<br></br>
*I'm italic text*<br></br>
`I'm code text`

There are also a lot of colors. They can be created using the `<C color="...">` component!
**Try to use colors in combination with bold text for better visibility!**

When displaying large amounts of data, you can use lists & tables like these:

<FlexHorizontal mode="left">
    <div style={{width:"25%"}}>
    #### Normal List
    - Data A
        - Data A.1
        - Data A.2
    - Data B
        - Data B.1
        - Data B.2
    - Data C
        - Data C.1
        - Data C.2
    </div>

    <div style={{width:"25%"}}>
    #### Numbered List
    1. Data A
        1. Data A.1
        2. Data A.2
    2. Data B
        1. Data B.1
        2. Data B.2
    3. Data C
        1. Data C.1
        2. Data C.2
    </div>

    <div style={{width:"25%"}}>
    #### Mixed List
    1. Data A
        - Data A.1
        - Data A.2
    2. Data B
        - Data B.1
        - Data B.2
    3. Data C
        - Data C.1
        - Data C.2
    </div>

    <div style={{width:"25%"}}>
    #### Checkbox List
    - [x] Data A
        - [x] Data A.1
        - [ ] Data A.2
    - [x] Data B
        - [x] Data B.1
        - [ ] Data B.2
    - [x] Data C
        - [x] Data C.1
        - [ ] Data C.2
    </div>

</FlexHorizontal>

<FlexHorizontal mode="left">
    <div>
    #### Horizontal Table
    |Column 1|Column 2|Column 3|
    |--------|--------|--------|
    |Row 1   |        |        |
    |Row 2   |        |        |
    |Row 3   |        |        |
    </div>
    <div>
    #### Vertical Table
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Row 1</th>
            <td>Column 1</td>
            <td>Column 2</td>
            <td>Column 3</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Row 2</th>
            <td></td>
            <td></td>
            <td></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Row 3</th>
            <td></td>
            <td></td>
            <td></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Row 4</th>
            <td></td>
            <td></td>
            <td></td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    </div>
</FlexHorizontal>

#### Code Blocks
There are also code blocks! You can use them to show data with a little bit syntax-highlighting!
You can customise the language, title & line numbering!

```json
{
    "abc":123,
    "hey":"Hello World!"
}
```
```javascript title="test.js" showLineNumbers
//this is coooooool!
const a = 1
const b = 2
const c = a+b
console.log("hello world",c)
```
```diff title="changelog"
ADDED:
+ something cool
+ very small features
+ a rickroll

REMOVED:
- boring stuff
- old stuff
```

#### Admonitions
Admonitions are special notes that deserve extra attention! You can put any other Markdown inside of them (so you can see them as a sort of container)

:::tip your custom title here
This is the `tip` admonition! Use it for giving tips to users!
:::
:::warning your custom title here
This is the `warning` admonition! Use it for something very important!
:::
:::danger your custom title here
This is the `danger` admonition! Use it for something that is so important that you absolutely need to see it!
:::
:::info your custom title here
This is the `info` admonition! Use it for something that deservers attention, but isn't important!
:::
:::note your custom title here
This is the `note` admonition! This admonition is rarely used! (An alternative for the `info` admonition)

# Content & Readability
- ✅ All text in the docs needs to be in **English**.
- ✅ Include enough details to fill the page.
- ✅ Split large pages up in multiple smaller ones.
- ✅ Use Admonitions **only when needed**! Most of the time, you can also just use colored text!
- ✅ Check your text for grammatical errors before uploading!
- ✅ When you write an article in the blog, make sure it's linked to your name!
